Usage Guide: PINN and SPF-PINN Experimental Code
This project contains three Jupyter Notebook files corresponding to the three experiments in the Numerical Results section of the paper: the nonlinear Duffing equation, the wave equation, and the mKdV equation.

Contents of Each File
PINN Implementation、SPF-PINN Methods、SPF-PINN-1、SPF-PINN-4

NTK Analysis:

PINN + NTK: Records NTK (Neural Tangent Kernel) eigenvalues for the standard PINN.

SPF-PINN-4 + NTK: Records NTK eigenvalues under SPF-PINN.

NTK-comparison: Plots mean and variance of NTK eigenvalues for both PINN and SPF-PINN for comparison.

Recommendations
Python 3.8+ is recommended. Please install PyTorch, Matplotlib, Numpy, and other standard scientific libraries.

Each notebook can be run independently by executing the cells in order.
